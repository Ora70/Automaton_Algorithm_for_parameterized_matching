# Automaton_Algorithm_for_parameterized_matching
this program implements the automaton algorithm for parameterized matching and the naive algorithm for parameterzid matching.
The purpose of the project is to test the algorithmns and to find out in what situations is it better to use each one, based on the length of the pattern, to size of the alphabet, the position of the matches etc.
